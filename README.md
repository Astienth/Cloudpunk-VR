# <b>Controls</b></br>
No motion controller support. You need a gamepad or keyboard/mouse.
</br>

# <b>Options</b></br>
The game is pretty heavy on performances especially in VR.
- Depending on your performances, lower the ingame settings.
- If this is not enough, start by lowering the VR headset resolution.
- In the game root folder in /BepInEx/config. You'll find a txt file called "CloudpunkVR.cfg".
- In this file you will have the following options:

<b>maxVehicleCharactersDivider</b> = 1
=> This can lower the number of vehicles and pedestrians ingame. It can help with framerate. It is a divider. If there are 100 vehicles ingame and you put 2 here, there will be 100 / 2 vehicles.

<b>RainAndSheetsRenderer</b> = true
=> this can disable the rain falling in front of you if you prefer. true = rain active, false = rain inactive.

# <b>Deactivate the VR mod</b></br>
If you wanna deactivate the VR mod, you just need to rename the file <b>winhttp.dll</b> in the game root folder.</br>
It can be named anything BUT "winhttp.dll".</br>
"winhttp" = mod active </br>
"anythingelse" = mod inactive. </br>
